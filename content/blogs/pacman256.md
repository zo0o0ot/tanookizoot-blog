There's a nice little remake of Pac-Man called [PAC-MAN 256](https://store.steampowered.com/app/455400/PACMAN_256/), and it is fun both as a single player as well as a cooperative game.  If you are able to eat 256 dots in a row, you clear the screen and the game gives you a fun little message.  I was able to do it on stream!

Feel free to check it out below!
