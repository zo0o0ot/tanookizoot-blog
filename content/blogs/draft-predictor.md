Leading up to the NFL Draft, I decided to stream myself doing mock drafts with the [PFF Mock Draft Simulator](https://www.pff.com/draft/nfl-mock-draft-simulator), and I decided to play a little mock draft analyst with my draft for the Green Bay Packers.  It certainly didn't go the way I expected it to go, but I'm still happy with the results.

Feel free to check it out below!
