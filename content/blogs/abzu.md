Last year, during one of my [Extra Life](https://www.extra-life.org/) charitry streams, I played some indie games from beginning to end, such as [Gris](https://nomada.studio/). I also got to play a very interesting game called Abzu.  One of the things that you can do in the game is grab onto the fin of a fish and swim with them.  Near the end, the marine creatures that you can ride are pretty impressive.

Feel free to check it out!

This clip is near the end of the game.  I don't think that it spoils anything in particular, though.
